<h1>Hello, my name is Kayla Devila!</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h4><em>I am a passionate Filipina-American visual designer.</em></h4>
<h5>Currently, I am an undergraduate student studying Visual Communication Design at SF State. I also work part-time for the Center of Global Engagement department, helping guide international students in their journey of studying in the States.</h5>
<h5>My design inspiration and solutions stem from influences within my own cultural
    heritage and personal upbringing. Filipino heritage is centered around the idea of community, and within my design choices, I create with this intention in mind. I center
    my design around inclusivity, form and aesthetic appeal, and user functionality. I value teamwork and believe open communication is a mandatory principle, not only within
    design but throughout one's personal life. As creativity flourishes within the mind, it is only further expedited and enhanced when working with others.
    Practicing intentionality helps to drive these skills, as evidenced in the colorful and vivid persona found in my design work. In my brand design work, inspiration can be seen
    from forms of both a natural and digital space, such as the curvatures and shaping of natural organic elements blended with abstract art qualities. When I'm not busy creating,
    I focus on other mediums of creativity, with many being musically-oriented activities. Within the musical world, one must balance various elements such as tempo/rhythm,
    knowledge of material, and memorization skills. These features are parallel to the design world as one must be versed in multiple foundations, whether it be knowledge of workspaces,
    visual skills, or other.. As I continue along my design journey, I am confident that I will be led to a richer understanding of the world and that I can discover my design “voice.”
