    <h5>Kayla discovered Olivia Dean about three years ago and ever since, her discography and the variety within it have served as inspiration. Olivia Dean's music
        contains a mix of genres, though primarily pop-soul/R&B, yet she does have songs with folk, jazz, and blues elements. Additionally, the visual
        marketing of her songs and brand are shown to have high aesthetic appeal. Within Olivia's songs, there are common elements of infatuation, insecurity, and independence.
        The closing song from her 2023 debut Messy album titled "Carmen" was written as a dedication to her late grandmother bearing the same name as the track, which Kayla heavily
        resonates with as someone who held a close bond to a grandmother who eventually passed. </h5>

    <h5>Being a former dancer herself, Kayla finds herself fascinated by the dance stylings of actress Briar Nolet. The actress was first known to Kayla from her appearance on the show "The Next Step",
        however, she's continued to keep up with her through socials. In real life, her main dance styling is contemporary dance
        which is known to be a more softer, slower side of interpretive dance. Funnily enough, during her dancing years, Kayla Devila also practiced contemporary as her main style and to this day, still
        believes contemporary to be her major dance form. Seeing Briar in a space she could relate to and a figure who could
        harness the skill of communication through movement rather than words was motivating. To this day, she credits the show and actors like Briar for playing a role in keeping her dance interest and passion alive.</h5>

        <a class="inspo" href="https://www.slimsfashion.com/our-founder.html"><h3>Salvacion Lim Higgins aka <em>Slim</em></h3></a>
        <img src="img/dresses.jpeg" alt="Traditional Filipiniana dresses designed by Salvacion in a row of three" class="artists">

    <h5>Being of Filipino heritage herself, Kayla finds that she constantly takes aspects of her culture in mind when working on projects.
        This could be anything from visual inspiration to learned community beliefs/morals (such as the principle of inclusivity).
        Salvacion is a designer that Kayla first gained interest in upon researching her as a possible subject for a class project. Salvacion took the fashion industry by storm
        with her innovative and out-of-ordinary designs, pushing the boundaries of her creativity. Soon, Salvacion would go on to be the founder
        of her own fashion institute shortly after, entitled The Slim's Fashion and Arts School (located in the Philippines) that still exists to this day!
        Having that cultural connection with Salvacion not only shows Kayla what's possible for someone within their community, but also serves as a reminder
        of the resilience their community possesses. Creative media within the Philippines is typically celebrated through hobbies, however, it is
        shunned upon if pursued career-wise. Yet, a figurehead like Salvacion instills confidence in a designer like Kayla and provides inspiration
        and creativity to use throughout their design journey.</h5>
